/**
 * Premium interaction haptics via react-native-pulsar (Software Mansion).
 * Semantic vocabulary — components never call Pulsar directly.
 *
 * DEGRADES TO NO-OPS when the native module is absent.
 *
 * `react-native-pulsar` is a classic RN TurboModule (`codegenConfig`
 * RNPulsarSpec, `expoModule: false`), so it only exists once it has been
 * autolinked into a native build. Any JS-only reload — Fast Refresh, an OTA
 * update, or a dev client whose binary predates the dependency — reaches a
 * `TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing('RNPulsar')` that throws and takes the
 * whole screen down.
 *
 * Haptics are an enhancement, never a requirement, so a missing binary must
 * cost the user a vibration and nothing else. The import is resolved lazily and
 * guarded; the first failure is reported once and then silently ignored.
