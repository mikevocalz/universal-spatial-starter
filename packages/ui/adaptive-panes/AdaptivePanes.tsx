            THE DETAIL PANE IS LAST IN THE ROW, AND THAT IS ITS STACKING.

            Nothing here sets a z-index. On Android a sibling paints in tree
            order, so the last child of the row is already above the panes
            before it — and the panes before it are inside `CollapsiblePane`,
            which clips (`overflow-hidden`), so a tall or overflowing child in a
            leading pane cannot paint across this one. React Native does not
            clip children by default, and a pane that overflowed its neighbour
            is exactly the bug a z-index would have papered over instead of
            fixed. If something ever does paint over this pane, the clip on the
            offender is the fix, not a number here.

            `flex-1` only while it is visible: a hidden detail must contribute
            no width, and `w-0` beside a `flex-1` sibling is what makes the
            neighbours take the space back.
          */}
          {/*
            IT COLLAPSES LIKE THE OTHERS, because it is the same component.

            It was once a `flex-1` / `w-0` class swap, so the trailing pane
            appeared and vanished in one frame while every other pane animated
            its width. `CollapsiblePane` is what the leading panes already use:
            an animated width on its own node, with the neighbours reflowing
            frame by frame. `fill` keeps it absorbing the window while open,
            growing from the token rather than `flex-1`, which would discard
            the width it collapses along.

            A canvas in this pane is NOT resized across the collapse:
            `CollapsiblePane` clips over an inner view that holds the measured
            width, so the surface keeps its size while the clip moves.

              THE ROW STAYS, ONLY ITS BUTTONS GO. Collapsed, the toggles have
              nothing to toggle — one pane is the whole window and hiding it
              would empty the screen — but this element cannot be the thing that
              disappears.

              Measured: with `{paneControls && !collapsed ? <View/> : null}`
              here, the detail pane below it remounted on every collapse and
              lost its state, while the two column panes kept theirs. A sibling
              that becomes `null` does not reliably hold its slot — somewhere in
              the landmark wrapper the children are normalised and the nulls
              drop out, which shifts `PaneContent` up an index and makes it a
              different position to React. Keeping an empty `View` here keeps
              the index, and the detail pane's draft survives the resize.

          the wrong trade for a secondary surface. This also matches UIKit, where
          the inspector is presented over the secondary column rather than tiled
          beside it.
