## NeonBlade UI

Several components in this package are ports of, or started from, components
in NeonBlade UI by NeuronRush: https://github.com/vprix21/neonblade-ui

Ported so far:

- `three/HolographicTerrain`: port of NeonBlade's Holographic Terrain
  (`holographic-terrain`). Same plane geometry, four-sine height, cursor
  gaussian bump raycast onto a horizontal plane, FogExp2 and camera, on
  WebGPURenderer with the height written as a TypeGPU function. Keeps its
  props; colours default to the kit theme, and an `accentColor` tints the
  lines the cursor lifts.
- `neon/`: the colour presets (cyan, pink, green, white, orange, purple, red,
  yellow), the corner-cut geometry (`ccb-clip-*`), the xs to xl size scale and
  the glow intensity presets follow NeonBlade's corner-cut button.
- `elements/AccentFrame`: NeonBlade's Accent Frame (`accent-frame`), redrawn
  with setback and cornice corners. Keeps its colour, corner, hover, mode and
  background props.
- `elements/Timeline`: NeonBlade's Timeline (`timeline`), redrawn as a subway
  line. Keeps its item shape and variant, line, dot, align and animate props.
- `Badge` (`variant="neon"`): NeonBlade's Badge (`badge`). Its solid, outline
  and ghost variants are the `fill` prop; size, shape, dot and glow carry over.
- `Dialog` / `DialogCard` (`variant="neon"`), `ToastCard` and `Toast`
  (`appearance="neon"`), `notify` (`variant: 'neon'`): NeonBlade's Neon Modal
  (`neon-modal`), redrawn as a building facade; keeps its size, animation,
  glow, footer-align, close-button, backdrop, label, dividers, border beam
  (a window marquee), scrollable body, Escape and header props. `notify.modal`
  opens the same facade through the sonner toasters.
- `progress/ProgressBar`, `RainLoader`, `ArrowLoader`, `CircularProgress`,
  `TurbineLoader`: NeonBlade's Progress Bar, Rain Loader, Arrow Loader,
  Circular Progress and Turbine Loader, redrawn as a building skyline, window
  lights, subway chevrons, a segmented token ring and a rooftop water tower
  with a fan. Each keeps the original props that still apply.
- `Button` and `IconButton` `variant="cornerCut"`: port of NeonBlade's
  corner-cut button (`corner-cut-button`).
- `Card` `variant="notch"`, `"cornerCut"` and `"beam"`: ports of NeonBlade's
  notch card, neon glow corner-cut card and border beam corner-cut card. The
  notch geometry in `cards/notch.ts` follows the notch card's clip path, and
  the props keep NeonBlade's names (`notchSides`, `notchSize`, `notchWidth`,
  `notchWidthV`, `notchSkew`, `corner`, `cornerSize`, `duration`).
- `TextField`, `Textarea`, `Select`, `Checkbox` and `Switch` `variant="neon"`:
  ports of NeonBlade's neon input, neon select, neon checkbox and neon toggle.
- `cards/CardSlider`: port of NeonBlade's card slider (`visibleCount`, `gap`,
  `showButtons`, `buttonPosition`, `buttonVisibility`, `prevButtonCorner`,
  `nextButtonCorner`, `enableSwipe`, `swipeThreshold`, `showProgress`,
  `progressStyle`, `loop`, `autoPlay`, `autoPlayInterval`, `showEdgeFades`,
  `edgeFadeColor`, `showCornerAccents`, `cornerAccentStyle`, `scanLines`).
- `charts/`: NeonLineChart, NeonSparkline, NeonBarChart, NeonDonutChart and
  StatCard keep the prop names of NeonBlade's neon-line-chart, neon-sparkline,
  neon-bar-chart, neon-donut-chart and stat-card (data, series, dataKey,
  xAxisKey, area, grid, legend, glowIntensity, barGap, radius, multiColor,
  dots, curve, paddingAngle, cornerRadius, centerLabel, color, tooltip,
  trend, change, sparkData, background...).
- `DataTable` `variant="neon"`: NeonBlade's neon-table (title, striped,
  compact, grid, corners, pageSize, emptyText, loading, rowHover).
- `Text` `variant="glitch" | "neonGlow" | "outline" | "blur"`: NeonBlade's
  glitch-text, neon-glow, outline-text and blur-text (mode, colorA, colorB,
  intensity, speed, colors, glowColor, glowIntensity, animate, strokeColor,
  fillColor, strokeWidth, hoverStrokeColor, hoverFillColor).
- `cursors/`: `MouseCursor` covers NeonBlade's fox-cursor, redrawn as an
  animated city mouse that chases the pointer (no fox); `PointerCursor` is
  a separate arrow pointer; `Crosshair` covers its crosshair (redrawn as a
  rounded-square reticle). All keep hideNativeCursor, disabled,
  containerRef and glowIntensity.

## react-native-graph

`charts/LinePlot.native.tsx` draws with react-native-graph by Margelo
(https://github.com/margelo/react-native-graph), MIT License, Copyright (c)
2026 Marc Rousavy. It is patched (`patches/react-native-graph@1.4.0.patch`) to
build paths with react-native-skia v3's SkPathBuilder.

## react-freeze

`adaptive-panes/pane-freeze.tsx` reproduces the `Freeze` component from
react-freeze 1.0.4 by Software Mansion (https://github.com/software-mansion/react-freeze),
MIT License, Copyright (c) 2021 Software Mansion. It is inlined so `@acme/ui`
does not take a dependency for a component of about fifteen lines.
