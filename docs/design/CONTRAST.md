# NYC-MON contrast table

Measured 2026-10-04 against `packages/theme/tokens.ts` (the only hex source; `theme.css` and `theme-native.css` are generated from it). WCAG 2.2 relative luminance with the 0.04045 linearisation threshold. Translucent colours (`/NN`) are composited over the layers beneath them before measuring.

The registry lives in `packages/theme/contrast.ts`; `packages/theme/contrast.test.ts` runs it (`pnpm --filter @acme/theme test`). Every table between `<!-- contrast:... -->` markers is written by `node packages/theme/contrast-docs.ts` from that registry, and the theme tests fail when a table is stale. If the two disagree, the code is right; regenerate rather than editing a number by hand.

## Thresholds

| Role | Minimum | WCAG |
|---|---:|---|
| text | 4.5:1 | 1.4.3, body text under 24px (18.66px bold) |
| large-text | 3:1 | 1.4.3, 24px+, or 18.66px+ bold |
| ui | 3:1 | 1.4.11, control edges, state marks, icons, chart marks |
| decorative | exempt | carries no information; a reason is required |
| disabled | exempt | inactive component; a reason is required |

## Summary

<!-- contrast:summary:start -->

- 393 measured rows: 369 pass, 0 fail, 24 exempt (decorative or disabled).

<!-- contrast:summary:end -->
- Semantic tokens are measured in light and dark. Palette steps (`orange-500`, `ink-950`) do not change with the theme and get one `both` row.
- Every semantic token on every surface passes as a token contract. The 10 failures measured in 5e9ce01 came from how screens combined tokens: opacity modifiers on text and focus rings, a tab bar that used a themed background under hard-coded white, and white labels on the apple face. All 10 are fixed; the findings table below records each one before and after.
- The kit's night facades (cards, fields, nav, tables, charts) pass everywhere. The tone tables in `packages/ui/district/tones.ts` already pick night or white per face by measurement.
- Tone colour as text straight on the page uses the themed `tone-<tone>-text` tokens (`TONE_CLASSES[tone].pageText`), not the night steps in `.text`. Dark keeps the night step; light takes a darker step measured on page, raised, sunken and under the ghost hover tint.

## Daylit findings

The daylit page (62e1772) put three kit classes on `concrete-50` that had only been measured on night. Each was fixed for every caller of the class:

- Field and form errors (`NEON_FIELD.message`: TextField, Textarea, Select, FormField, ErrorMessage, NeonCheckbox; the native VoiceRecorder error) drew `text-apple-400` on the page. They now use `text-danger`, the themed pair, which is `apple-400` inside night scopes. The old "apple tone text on night" row cited this class but measured it on night; the class now has its own row, "field error message on page".
- Ghost Button and ghost IconButton labels, and the CardSlider counter, drew the tone `.text` steps on the page (orange, royal, carolina, leaf, apple, brick). They now draw `pageText`, the new `tone-*-text` tokens; rows "<tone> ghost label on page" and "... on hover tint".
- The native VoiceRecorder hint under its controls drew `text-silver-300` on the page; it now uses `text-text-muted`.

Text and Heading `tone="district"` still draw the night `.text` step by design: they are documented for night faces, and a themed token there would turn dark on an unscoped night facade.

## Findings

The 10 failing rows from 5e9ce01, fixed by class rather than by instance (every occurrence of the failing class was changed, not only the cited line).

| # | Where | Before | Measured before | After | Measured after |
|---|---|---|---:|---|---:|
| 1 | `packages/app/features/schedule/MiniCalendar.tsx:111` | out-of-month day `text-text-muted/50` on `surface-raised` | light 2.29, dark 3.36 | `text-text-muted`. The days stay pressable (`onSelect`), so they are not disabled; the muted colour against `text-text` marks them as outside the month. | 7.15 / 10.08 |
| 2 | `packages/app/features/schedule/BookingSurface.tsx:74` | past day `text-text-muted/50` | light 2.24, dark 3.35 | `text-text-muted`. Past days still call `selectDate`, so they must pass. The day strip sits in the `bg-surface-raised` panel (line 48); the old row measured it on `surface`. | 7.15 / 10.08 |
| 3 | `apps/mobile/components/AppTabBar.tsx:97`, `:109`, `:128` | grid tab idle `text-white/70` on `bg-bg/95` | light 1.04 | Grid bar is a night facade in both themes: `bg-ink-950/95` (rail `bg-ink-950`), idle `text-silver-300`. Measured over a light page, the 95% bar's worst case. | 14.17 (rail 15.36) |
| 4 | `apps/mobile/components/AppTabBar.tsx:84`, `:96`, `:108` | grid tab active `text-primary` on `bg/95 + primary/15` | light 4.29 | `text-orange-400` on `ink-950/95 + orange-500/15`; slab edge `border-orange-500/60` (3.02, ui). | 7.41 |
| 5 | `packages/ui/Button.tsx:23`, `IconButton.tsx:20`, `SearchBar.tsx:26`, `SegmentedControl.web.tsx:16` | focus ring `ring-focus/60` | light 2.68 | `ring-focus`. With `ring-offset-bg` the ring sits on the page colour (5.27 / 7.89); without an offset it sits on the night control face (3.63 / 7.89). | 5.27 / 7.89 |
| 6 | `apps/web/components/site/SiteHeader.tsx` (6 sites), `SiteFooter.tsx:21`, `packages/ui/cards/NeonSwitch.tsx:19`, `NeonCheckbox.tsx:13`, `CardSlider.web.tsx:144` | focus ring `ring-focus/50` | light 2.24, dark 2.66 | `ring-focus` (header on `surface` 5.27 / 7.89, footer on `surface-sunken` 4.74 / 8.02). | 4.74 min |
| 7 | `packages/ui/dropdown.ts:28`, `packages/ui/nav/NavBar.tsx:83` | active item `text-white` on `bg-apple-500` | 4.21 | `text-ink-950`, what `TONE_CLASSES.apple.onFace` uses. | 4.83 |

`ring-offset-2` now always names its band colour. Button, IconButton, NeonSwitch, NeonCheckbox, CardSlider (web) and the primitives story use `ring-offset-bg`, which follows the theme on the page and resolves to night inside `NightScope` / `scheme-dark` faces. PlayerShell (`ring-offset-ink-900`), CircuitButton and the site header profile ring (`ring-offset-surface`) already set one.

## §1.3 rules against the real tokens

The prompt's Knicks numbers were approximations. The repo samples its anchors from the logo: orange `#FC7C00`, royal `#0058F8`, night `#00041C`, banner white `#F8F8F8`. Measured:

| §1.3 approximation | Repo pair | Repo ratio | Verdict |
|---|---|---:|---|
| White on blue ≈ 5.6 | `white` on `royal-500` | 5.60 | body text OK |
| Orange on blue ≈ 2.2 | `orange-500` on `royal-500` | 2.14 | fails text and 3:1 UI |
| Black on orange ≈ 8 | `ink-950` (night) on `orange-500` | 7.76 | button label OK |
| White on orange ≈ 2.6 | `white` on `orange-500` | 2.62 | fails |
| Blue on white ≈ 5.6 | `royal-500` on `ink-50` | 5.27 | OK |

**Is orange on royal used anywhere?** No. A same-line scan of `packages/ui`, `packages/app`, `apps/web/{app,components}` and `apps/mobile/{app,components}` finds no `text-/border-/stroke-/fill-orange-*` next to `bg-royal-*`. The closest case is the chart keyline: `keylineFor()` (`packages/ui/district/series.ts:75`) draws a royal keyline under orange strokes (`NeonLineChart.tsx:129`). The stroke sits on night (7.76), and the keyline is registered as decorative.

**White on orange buttons anywhere?** No. The scan finds no `text-white`/`text-ink-50` beside `bg-orange-500` or `bg-primary`. Orange faces take night text: `TONE_CLASSES.orange.onFace` (`tones.ts:117`), `dropdown.ts:19`, `NavBar.tsx:69`, and `on-primary` resolves to night in dark mode. In light mode `primary` is `orange-700` and `on-primary` is white: 5.62, an orange-700 face, not the brand orange.

**Orange is an accent on night and neutrals.** Orange as text on night uses `orange-400` (9.74) or `orange-500` (7.76). Orange on the light page measures 2.46 and fails even 3:1, so light-mode `primary` is `orange-700`. The same holds for carolina (2.42) and leaf (2.70); light mode uses `info` (`carolina-800`) and `success` (`leaf-700`).

**Royal is structure, not text, on night.** `royal-500` on night is 3.63: fine for borders and chart marks, short of 4.5 for text. Royal labels use `royal-300` (8.92).

The test keeps these honest: each forbidden pair below must still measure under its threshold (otherwise the rule is stale), and the same-line scan fails the build if a white-on-orange or orange-on-royal class pair appears in component code. The scan is a heuristic. It reads tone tables and `tv()` slot maps, where a face and its label share a line, and misses classes composed across lines.

|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| orange on royal | `orange-500` #FC7C00 on `royal-500` #0058F8 | 2.14 | 3 | Orange is an accent on night and neutrals; never orange text or marks on royal. |
| white on orange | `white` #FFFFFF on `orange-500` #FC7C00 | 2.62 | 4.5 | No white-on-orange labels. Orange faces take night text (on-primary in dark). |

| orange on light | `orange-500` #FC7C00 on `ink-50` #F8F8F8 | 2.46 | 3 | Brand orange is not text, icon or chart ink on a light surface; use primary (orange-700) there. |
| carolina on light | `carolina-500` #4BA8F0 on `ink-50` #F8F8F8 | 2.42 | 3 | Carolina is a night colour; on light use info (carolina-800). |

| apple on light (text) | `apple-500` #F80000 on `ink-50` #F8F8F8 | 3.96 | 4.5 | Apple on light holds 3:1 for marks only; text uses danger (apple-600). |
| royal on night (text) | `royal-500` #0058F8 on `ink-950` #00041C | 3.63 | 4.5 | Royal reads as structure on night, never as text; royal text uses royal-300. |
| orange on daylit page | `orange-500` #FC7C00 on `concrete-50` #F3F4F4 | 2.38 | 3 | Orange is a face on daylit (cta), never text, icon or line. |
| LED on Core body | `led-on` #F80000 on `hlynk-core-body` #D50000 | 1.30 | 3 | The LED, emitters and the trackpad ring never touch bare body plastic; they sit on black. |
| apple-400 on Core body | `apple-400` #FA4040 on `hlynk-core-body` #D50000 | 1.53 | 3 | Same for the lighter red. |
| black text on Core body | `signage-black` #000000 on `hlynk-core-body` #D50000 | 3.83 | 4.5 | Black is a control face on the body, never text. Text on the body is hlynk-core-ink (white). |
